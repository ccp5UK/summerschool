    "## Introduction\n",
    "How do we simulate molecules which have strong internal bonds,\n",
    "as well as nonbonded interactions (such as Lennard-Jones) between the atoms?\n",
    "One approach \n",
    "is to allow the bond lengths etc to evolve \n",
    "under the influence of appropriate terms \n",
    "(for example, strong harmonic springs) \n",
    "in the potential energy. \n",
    "However, this requires a correspondingly small timestep, \n",
    "which can make the program very inefficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach is to fix the bond lengths by applying constraints.\n",
    "The introduction of a practical way of doing this \n",
    "is one of the most important developments in molecular dynamics. \n",
    "It enables the simulation of molecules of great complexity \n",
    "with a high degree of stability and reliability. \n",
    "The original SHAKE algorithm was derived by \n",
    "Ryckaert *et al*, \n",
    "[*J Comput Phys,* **23,** 327 (1977)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0021-9991(77)90098-5), \n",
    "based on the Verlet algorithm: \n",
    "at each step, an iterative method is used \n",
    "to ensure that the bond lengths, angles, or other geometrical quantities, \n",
    "satisfy the imposed constraints. \n",
    "Somewhat later, a version based on the velocity Verlet algorithm\n",
    "was derived by Andersen, \n",
    "[*J Comput Phys,* **52,** 24 (1983)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0021-9991(83)90014-1), \n",
    "called RATTLE. \n",
    "This is essentially equivalent to SHAKE for the positions, \n",
    "but also ensures that the atomic velocities are consistent with the constraint conditions.\n",
    "Subsequently, several other algorithms have been developed to tackle constraints,\n",
    "with better performance in certain circumstances (e.g. LINCS, SETTLE).\n",
    "To compare with RATTLE, here we look at MILC SHAKE,\n",
    "which applies to linear chain topologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we still wish to simulate the bond vibrations explicitly, \n",
    "instead of using constraints,\n",
    "one idea is to use multiple timesteps (MTS).\n",
    "This permits\n",
    "the expensive intermolecular interactions \n",
    "to be evaluated much less frequently than \n",
    "the rapidly-changing intramolecular spring forces,\n",
    "making the program more efficient;\n",

    "[*J Chem Phys*, 97, 1990 (1992)](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.463137).\n",
    "However, there are still dangers and limitations on the timesteps that can be used.\n",
    "This method is illustrated at the end of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "One should bear in mind that \n",
    "these two models (springs and constraints) are _not equivalent_ to each other, \n",
    "even in the limit of very strong springs, \n",
