    "# LBE Tutorial Exercise 2: Multi-Component LBE simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now extending our single-component LBE calculations from the previous exercise to look at systems with additional fluid components, using an approach for multi-component lattice Boltzmann (MCLB) to model how different fluids interact and affect their flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with the custom simulation program [CCP5_02.c](CCP5_02.c), which has fully periodic boundary conditions and models a 2D bulk with two lattice Boltzmann fluids. It models a 'red' fluid drop at rest in the centre of a square lattice; periodic boundary conditions make this into an array of identical drops. It generates a single CSV (comma-separated values) file called ``density.csv`` and four other files (``data_density.dat``, ``data_rhoN.dat``, ``data_nK.dat`` and ``data_psi.dat``) that report the overall fluid density $\\rho = \\rho_R + \\rho_B$, the phase index $\\rho^N = \\frac{\\rho_R - \\rho_B}{\\rho}$, the interfacial curvature $K$ and the velocity modulus (speed) $|\\mathbf{u}|$ at each grid point for the final timestep. The CSV file can be read into spreadsheet programs or used with our Python plotting scripts, while the others in fixed-length delimited format can be read into e.g. Gnuplot.\n",
