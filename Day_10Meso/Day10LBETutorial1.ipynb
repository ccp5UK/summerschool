    "We are going to work with a simple two-dimensional LBE code written in C, [CCP5_01.c](CCP5_01.c), which applies single-relaxation-time Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collisions, i.e. LBE with BGK or **LBGK**. This code will carry out LBE over a certain number of timesteps and write out files with results for the final calculation timestep. \n",

    "The ``data_density.csv`` and ``data_density.dat`` files print the fluid density $\\rho (x, y)$ at each grid point, while the ``data_stfn.csv`` and ``data_stfn.dat`` files print a scalar stream function, $\\psi (x, y)$, which can be used to plot lines where flow speeds are constant. (More details about stream functions can be found in our [Outline Notes on Fluid Mechanics](https://ccp5.gitlab.io/summerschool/Appendix%20C.html).) The two sets of files are in different formats: the files with comma-separated values (CSV) can be read into spreadsheet programs or used with our Python plotting scripts, while the other files are formatted using fixed-length delimiting and can be read into e.g. Gnuplot. \n",

We are going to ask you to make some modifications to this code for some of the exercises: if you are not entirely familiar with C, we have some hints on how to make modifications to codes written in this language in [our introduction to the Mesoscale Exercises](https://ccp5.gitlab.io/summerschool/Day9-11Mesoscale.html)."
