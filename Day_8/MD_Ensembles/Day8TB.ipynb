    "Finally, here is another reminder that some \"thermostats\", even some widely-used ones, do not generate the canonical $NVT$ ensemble. They may not generate any equilibrium ensemble at all! Even if they do, in principle, correspond to a well-defined ensemble, they may, in practice, produce unphysical velocity distributions (sometimes called the \"flying ice cube effect\"). This can be dangerous: there are published papers containing incorrect results which have been traced back to a poor choice of thermostat. You may like to read Braun *et al*, \n",
