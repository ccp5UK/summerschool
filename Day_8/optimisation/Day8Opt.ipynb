    "\n",
    "As you heard in the lectures, a vital component of most simulations is\n",
    "the specification of a force-field or potential. In this exercise you\n",
    "will investigate the behaviour of two potentials for alumina, *a rigid\n",
    "ion pair potential model with fitted ionic charges and a shell model\n",
    "pair potential with full ionic charges*. Neither model is completely\n",
    "satisfactory as a model for alumina. By the end of the exercise, you\n",
    "should be able to answer two questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1.  What kinds of investigation would you use each model for?\n",
    "> 2.  What further tests would you think it necessary to do for a\n",
    ">     specific problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "On the way, we shall also investigate the use of a number of\n",
    "optimisation methods. We shall use the GULP code[1] developed by Julian\n",
    "Gale and co-workers. This is a general-purpose code that, amongst other\n",
    "things, performs optimisations on lattice structures, surfaces and point\n",
    "defects. Full details of the program’s capabilities can be found in the\n",

    "In the shell model used, this is fixed at +3 (Al). The shell model has\n",
    "two further parameters that describe the polarisability of the ions. The\n",
