    "# DPD Tutorial Exercise 2: Applying DPD to molecular systems\n",
    "## Ex2. Lipid bilayers, micelles and vesicles\n",
    "\n",
    "Following on from amphiphilic dimers in the [previous exercise](Day9DPDTutorial2Ex1.ipynb), we can construct longer, more realistic amphiphilic molecules - often with smaller hydrophilic head groups and longer hydrophobic tails - such as surfactants and *lipids* (naturally occurring hydrophobic or amphiphilic molecules, e.g. fats, waxes, sterols). Larger molecules can incorporate more complex topologies, such as interactions that control the angles between adjacent bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will use a DPD model for a lipid molecule consisting of a hydrophilic bead and six hydrophobic beads joined together with harmonic bonds, along with a cosine bond angle potential:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_{ijk} = A [1 + \\cos (m\\theta_{ijk} - \\theta_0)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "to conctrol the angle between pairs of bonds. The angles will have an effect on the structures that the lipids form, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* micelles - spherical structures with hydrophobic tails pointing inwards\n",
    "* bilayers - two planar layers of lipids with hydrophobic tails pointing towards each other\n",
    "* vesicles (liposomes) - spherical kinds of bilayer with hydrophilic head groups and solvent inside\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the required simulations are fairly large, we are going to use SCARF to run DL_MESO_DPD. We have already compiled the parallel version of DL_MESO_DPD and one of the utilities (``traject_vtf.exe``) used to convert ``HISTORY`` files to VTF files for VMD to run on SCARF. We have also uploaded input files ([CONTROL](DPD2Ex2/CONTROL) and [FIELD](DPD2Ex2/FIELD)) and created a [Slurm job script](DPD2Ex2/dpdjob) to run our lipid simulation. Note that most of the following require you to use a terminal window, and that you have already [setup access to SCARF](https://ccp5.gitlab.io/summerschool/Day9Intro.html#scarfsetup).\n",

    "This will put your simulation into the job queue and, when there are sufficient processor cores available, run DL_MESO_DPD on 32 cores for up to an hour before running the ``traject_vtf.exe`` utility to generate a ``traject.vtf`` file from the ``HISTORY`` file. (We have recently checked that the simulation should take around 10-15 minutes to run.) Note that while the next few steps that involve looking at the results will require you to wait until this simulation has finished, the other simulation setup steps will not, so feel free to skip ahead and come back here later after launching the other three simulations. (If the job queue is reasonably empty, all four calculations might start and finish at around the same time.)\n",
