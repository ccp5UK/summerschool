    "# Monte Carlo at Constant Pressure\n",
    "This exercise is intended to demonstrate the operation of a constant-pressure Monte Carlo program.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two other notebooks in this directory; \n",
    "you should have worked through both of them already in an earlier workshop.\n",
    "This exercise builds on some of the ideas already covered in the `MC-Lennard-Jones` notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In a system with pairwise-additive interactions $u(r)$ \n",
    "the virial expression for the pressure is given (see lecture notes) \n",
    "in terms of the pair virial function $r (du/dr)$. \n",
    "This function is calculated and accumulated in the same way as the pair potential. \n",
    "In a constant-pressure simulation the value of $P$ is input as a parameter, \n",
    "and there is no need to use the expression just mentioned, \n",
    "although it is always good to check that the measured average matches the input value. \n",
    "\n",
    "In such a simulation, the system size varies: \n",
    "the box volume is changed randomly $V\\rightarrow V+\\Delta V$, \n",
    "and the move accepted or rejected using a formula which depends on the specified value of $P$. \n",
    "Such a volume-changing move is typically attempted once per step, \n",
    "after $N$ attempted molecule displacements, where $N$ is the number of molecules.\n",
    "We can obtain the equation of state \n",
    "in the form of the average density $\\rho$ at given $P$, \n",
    "rather than averaging $P$ at fixed $\\rho$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system being studied here is the same one that was investigated in the `MC-Lennard-Jones` notebook,\n",
    "namely the cut-and-shifted Lennard-Jones potential with $r_{\\text{cut}}=2.5$ (in reduced units). \n",
    "Further details are given in that notebook.\n",
    "Moreover, the state point of interest is the same, $T=2.0$, $\\rho=0.5$,\n",
    "which lies in the supercritical region of the phase diagram.\n",
    "This state point was discussed in lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "Start by importing some useful Python modules and functions."

    "The potential energy change $\\Delta U$ associated with the trial move \n",
    "is a key element of the acceptance probability.\n",
    "Referring to the lecture notes,\n",
    "this may be written $\\min [1,e^{-\\delta}]$ where\n",

    "with similar expressions for $U$,\n",
    "and $\\beta=1/k_{\\text{B}}T$ as usual. \n",
    "The program defines a variable `delta`, to represent the value $\\delta$ here.\n",
    "This is passed to the `metropolis` function, \n",
    "which handles the $\\min [1,e^{-\\delta}]$ part of the calculation\n",
