    "The real interest in MCLB applications is in their dynamics; we want to simulate e.g. immiscible fluids interacting with each other. Imagine an oil drop in water. If the 'external' fluid (water here) moves, it exerts stresses on the surface of the oil and causes it to move, while the interior fluid (oil) impedes the motion of the water: action and reaction and all that. The resulting dynamics are complex: given the interface (with its own physics, as you can see in Ex1 in the [previous notebook](Day11LBETutorial2Ex1-3.ipynb)) deforms, re-locates the boundary between fluids, modifies the interaction ... hopefully you get the point! With MCLB, all of these physics are in place as you hopefully saw in [CCP5_02.c](CCP5_02.c) ... we will now try and convince you by switching to a more comprehensive LBE code.\n",

It can work in 3D but we will stick to 2D to allow fast computation and interaction/experimentation. In the last set of exercises, we shall configure and use DL_MESO_LBE to perform simulations of a neutrally buoyant drop of red fluid (oil) suspended in a blue fluid (water), which is moved at its boundaries to produce a shear flow (as seen in Figure 1 below).\n",
